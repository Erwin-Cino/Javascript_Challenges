    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Potato';
    console.log(players);


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
 
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //will copy the array
    team2[3] = 'Patatas';
    //Or we can do this to copy
    team3 = [].concat(players);
    // another solution
    const team4 = [...players];
    // Another one
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    console.log(team2);
    console.log(players);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age:44});
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    console.log(captain3);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
